description: One-time orchestrator that installs your AI Operating System in this project. Creates CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, and your AIOS Brain (the brain/ folder), then confirms everything is in place. Run this once per new project.

# /setup — AIOS Brain & Operating System Installer

## Purpose

Install the complete AI Operating System in the current project folder, including your AIOS Brain. This is a one-time command per project. Creates all files, populates them with the user's context, and runs verification.

## When To Use

- First time setting up Claude in a new project folder
- After installing the perfectlittlebusiness plugin
- When starting a new business, offer, or directory build

Do not run this in a project that already has CLAUDE.md unless the user wants to start fresh.

## Execution Instructions

### Phase 1: Verify Environment

1. Check if CLAUDE.md already exists at project root.
2. If it does, ask: "I see this project already has CLAUDE.md. Should I (a) abort to protect your existing setup, (b) back up the current files and create fresh, or (c) skip file creation and just install brain folder?"
3. Wait for user choice before proceeding.
4. If no existing setup, continue.

### Phase 2: Gather Context (Five Questions)

Ask one at a time. Wait for each answer before continuing.

**Q1:** "What's your project name? (e.g., coaching-directory, saas-platform, creative-studio)"

**Q2:** "What's your role? (e.g., founder, consultant, coach, creator, subject matter expert)"

**Q3:** "In one paragraph, what does your AIOS Brain need to know about your business? What do you do, who do you serve, what's the core problem you solve?"

**Q4:** "Give me three words that describe your brand voice. (e.g., calm/warm/intelligent or direct/playful/bold)"

**Q5:** "What's one core conviction that drives your work? Something you believe to be true that shapes how you operate."

Store all five answers. You'll use them in the next phase.

### Phase 3: Create Root Files

Create these files at the project root:

1. **CLAUDE.md** — populate using the template in this skill's reference section below. Fill in user's answers.

2. **MEMORY.md** — initialize with today's setup entry.

3. **.gitignore** — use standard content (see reference below).

4. **README.md** — brief project overview.

### Phase 4: Create the AIOS Brain

Create `brain/` with these files (templates in the reference section below):

- `source-of-truth.md` — populated with Q3 answer expanded
- `convictions.md` — populated with Q5 answer as Conviction 1
- `avatar-profile.md` — stub; populated when the user runs `/avatar-profile`
- `offer-architecture.md` — stub; populated when the user runs `/offer-architect`
- `brand-style-guide.md` — stub; populated when the user runs `/brand-style-guide`
- `learnings.md` — empty, ready to grow
- `decisions.md` — empty, ready to grow
- `wins.md` — empty, ready to grow
- `voice-samples/README.md` — instructions for adding voice samples
- `reference/README.md` — instructions for reference docs
- `templates/README.md` — instructions for reusable formats

The five foundational-tool files (`source-of-truth`, `convictions`, `avatar-profile`, `offer-architecture`, `brand-style-guide`) are your AIOS Brain. `/setup` stubs them; the five AIOS Brain tools fill them in.

### Phase 5: Verification

Confirm each file exists:

- [ ] CLAUDE.md
- [ ] MEMORY.md
- [ ] .gitignore
- [ ] README.md
- [ ] brain/source-of-truth.md
- [ ] brain/convictions.md
- [ ] brain/avatar-profile.md
- [ ] brain/offer-architecture.md
- [ ] brain/brand-style-guide.md
- [ ] brain/learnings.md
- [ ] brain/decisions.md
- [ ] brain/wins.md
- [ ] brain/voice-samples/README.md
- [ ] brain/reference/README.md
- [ ] brain/templates/README.md

### Phase 6: Completion Message

Output exactly this message:

```
✅ Your AI Operating System is installed.

**What's now running in this project:**
- Core files: CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, .gitignore, README.md
- Your AIOS Brain: the brain/ folder, eleven files ready to grow with you
- Operating skills: /start, /end, /hygiene, /learn, /decide, /recap, /digest, /ask, /granola-pull, /draft-social, /how-to
- Your five AIOS Brain tools: /avatar-profile, /offer-architect, /conviction-map, /brand-style-guide, /source-of-truth
- Plus /voice-qa (brand-voice gate) and /gravity-dossier
- Three protective hooks: credential guard, forbidden-language guard, session-end nudge

**Your test-drive automations are live immediately:**
- `/digest` — your personal weekly summary
- `/granola-pull` — pull meetings into your brain
- `/draft-social` — draft posts in your voice

**Next move:** Type `/start` to confirm the system loads. Then build your AIOS Brain by running your five foundational tools, beginning with `/avatar-profile`.

The operating system is installed. Your AIOS Brain is what you build inside it.

## Brand Voice

Three-word essence: [USER_ANSWER_4]

[Expand into a brief paragraph describing the tone, energy, and language style this implies. Keep under 100 words.]

## How To Work In This Project

### At Session Start
- Run `/start` to load full context
- Claude reads this file and your brain/ folder

### During The Session
- One project per session — do not switch contexts
- Use `/learn` to capture insights mid-session
- Use `/decide` after meaningful decisions
- Use `/ask` for questions grounded in your context

### At Session End
- Run `/end` to log the session and capture learnings
- Commit changes before closing

### Weekly
- Run `/hygiene` once per week (Sundays recommended)
- Run `/digest` for your weekly summary

---

```

The AIOS Brain is yours. Edit any file any time.

---

## Guardrails

- One project per session
- Never commit API keys, passwords, or credentials (the credential hook protects this)
- Approve before deploying
- Commit before closing
- Run `/end` at session close

---

## The Self-Improvement Loop

This system gets smarter every session through two files:

- **MEMORY.md** = project timeline (what happened)
- **brain/learnings.md** = business intelligence (what you discovered)

Every `/start` reads both. Every `/end` updates both. Over time, Claude builds an accurate model of this business — not from training data, but from your actual lived experience.

When advising you, Claude prioritizes your learnings.md over generic best practices. Your learnings reflect what's actually working for *this* business.

---

## Where the Methodology Lives

This plugin installs the *infrastructure layer* — your AIOS Brain and the operating skills. The Perfect Little Business methodology and full doctrine live in **Collective Wisdom** (perfectlittlebusiness.com), kept current there as the methodology evolves.

This file is yours. Your `brain/` folder is yours. Both stay clean by living separately from the methodology.
```

---

## MEMORY.md Template

```markdown
# Project Memory Log

This file is the timeline of every session. Updated automatically by `/end`.

---

## [TODAY'S_DATE] — AI Operating System Installed

**What happened:**
Initialized the AI Operating System using perfectlittlebusiness v1.3.0. Created CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, .gitignore, README.md, and the full AIOS Brain (brain/ folder). Your operating skills, your five AIOS Brain tools, and three protective hooks are now available.

**Git state:** Not yet committed
**Deploy state:** Not configured (optional, for later)

**Open items / next session:**
- Build your AIOS Brain: run `/avatar-profile`, `/offer-architect`, `/conviction-map`, `/brand-style-guide`, then `/source-of-truth`
- Drop 2-3 voice samples in brain/voice-samples/
- Run `/start` to confirm the system loads
- Try `/digest`, `/draft-social`, or `/granola-pull` to test-drive the automations

**To verify the system is working:** Type `/start` in your next session. Claude should read everything and ask what you want to work on.

- A piece of sales copy that worked

Don't overthink it. Variety helps. Update as your voice evolves.

## Notes for Claude Executing This Skill

- Do not skip questions. All five are required.
- Do not auto-generate content for files not explicitly templated above.
- If the user gives a very short answer to Q3, ask one clarifying question before proceeding. Then move on.
- If the user is uncomfortable answering Q5, accept a placeholder ("to be discovered") and note it in convictions.md.
- After completion, do NOT proceed to other work in the same response. The user needs to type `/start` to verify the install before doing anything else.
